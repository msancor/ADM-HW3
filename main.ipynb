    "For this homework, there was no provided dataset, instead, we had to build our own. We were asked to obtain relevant information for the courses contained in the [Find a Masters](https://www.findamasters.com/) website. Specifically, we were asked to obtain information for the Masters courses contained on the first **400** pages of the [MSc. Degrees](https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/msc-degrees/) section of the [Find a Masters](https://www.findamasters.com/) website.\n",

    "    - `scrape_urls()`. Scrapes the urls for all the courses within the [MSc. Degrees](https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/msc-degrees/) section of the [Find a Masters](https://www.findamasters.com/) website and saves them in a text file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - `scrape_htmls()`. Scrapes and saves the HTML file for each URL contained in the text file produced by the `scrape_urls()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HTMLParser`. This class parses each HTML file obtained with the `WebScraper.scrape_htmls()` method and obtains relevant information within these files. To do this it uses the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `parse_htmls()`. Parses information within the HTMLs (courses) obtained with the `WebScraper.scrape_htmls()` method and obtains: the name of the course, name of the university, name of the faculty, modality (MSc., full time/part time, online/on campus, etc.), description, start date, fees, duration, city, country, and URL, and saves all this information on tsv files.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `get_dataframe()`: Obtains a dataframe containing the parsed information of all the courses obtained with the `parse_htmls()` method.\n",
